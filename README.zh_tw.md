**Version 3.1.0**
- Hopefully temporary fixing the issue of being kicked by Innersloth servers for regular kills, until Innersloth fixes it on their side.
- **NOTE:** Do not combine modded and unmodded versions of the game (even if you don't activate anything). Because of the kicking fix, your kills won't be performed for players that do not share the exact same modded version. Due to this you now can't start a game as the host, if not everyone in the lobby has the same version of the mod. Additionally you'll be kicked out of a lobby after 10 seconds, if the host doesn't have the mod installed (or the same mod version).

- Bug fix: Fixed the visual bug where both Lovers always showed dead during the meeting after a correct guess of one of them even if the option "Both Lovers Die" was disabled

**Version 3.0.0**
- Updated to Among Us version v2021.11.9.5s
- **Note:** We wanted to update as fast as possible, that's why you can't use both the Innersloth and mod roles at the same time. We'll make that possible in the future, but there are various things that need to be modified (e.g. Shifter, Guesser, ...) to make that work, so that'll take a little longer. Also, be aware that this version might contain more bugs than usual because Innersloth changed a lot of things and we might have missed some of them.
- Ability buttons are now bind to the Q key (if it's a killing ability) or to the F key (otherwise). We'll make the binds adaptable in the future.

- Lover: New option that sets how often an ImpLover appears. If a Lover is exiled, their partner doesn't spawn a dead body anymore.
- Cooldowns now stop cooling down, if a player sits inside a vent.
- Fixed a bug that prevented the game from continuing after a meeting (for an edge case with Lovers)
- If two players try to kill each other at the same time both should die (e.g. Sheriff vs Impostor)
- We added a description for your current role right above the task list
- Added a description for the [Role Assignment System](#職業分配)

\
**Changes in v1.7:**
- **New Roles:** The Vampire, the Tracker and the Snitch are now in the game
- The role assignment system has been changed
- Impostors now see a blue outline around all vents of the map, if the Engineer sits inside one of them

\
**Changes in v1.6:**
- This update is a small hotfix, fixing the bug where some people were unable to join lobbies.
- The Mini can't be voted out anymore before it turns 18, hence games can't end anymore because the Mini died.
- Footprints are no longer visible to the Detective, if players are inside vents.

\
**Changes in v1.5:**
- Time Master - Buff: They are not affected by their rewind anymore, which gives them more utility. Players will now be rewound out of vents.
- Mini - Nerf: The Mini now grows up (see [Mini](#迷你)) and becomes a normal Crewmate at some point. A growing Mini is not killable anymore. Some tasks are still not doable for the small Mini, we are working on that. But eventually when growing up it can do all the tasks as it's size increases.
- Seer - Nerf: Added an option that sets how often the Seer mistakes the player for another.
- Hacker - Nerf: The Hacker now only sees the additional information when they activate their "Hacker mode". That should stop the Hacker from camping the admin table/vitals.
- Other: Camouflager/Morphling cooldowns were fixed. Custom regions code was removed to enable 3rd party tools. Some minor bugfixes.

**Changes in v1.4:**
- Fixing a Camouflager/Morphling animation bug
- Fixing a bug where the Swapper could swap votes even if they are dead
- The custom cooldown buttons now render the cooldown progress (the grey overlay) in the right way (v1.3 introduced the bug)
- Players in vents are not targetable anymore by the role actions, the button does not activate (e.g. Seer revealing, Morphling sample). Exception: Impostor killing an Engineer in a vent

**Changes in v1.3:**
- Adds support for the Among Us version **2021.3.5s**
- Fixes a bug where an edge case caused all players to start the game with the camouflaged look
- There might be a few bugs, since I focused on getting the update out fast. A new version resolving the bugs will be published tomorrow.

**Changes in v1.1:**
- Morphling: The color of pet now also morphs. The skin animation now starts at the right point.
- The game over screen now shows if the Jester/Mini/Lovers won.
- A bug was removed where the Jester won together with the Crewmates.
- A bug was removed where the game of the Lovers crashed if they were the last players killed by the host of the lobby.

# 安裝

## Windows Installation Steam
1. Download the newest [release](https://github.com/Eisbison/TheOtherRoles/releases/latest)
2. Find the folder of your game. You can right click on the game in your library, a menu will appear, click on properties, local data, browse
3. Go back one folder to common and make a copy of your Among Us game folder and paste it somewhere on the same drive.
4. Now unzip and drag or extract the files from the .zip into your Among Us game folder that you just copied, at the `.exe` level (just into the folder).
5. Run the game by starting the .exe from this folder (the first launch might take a while).

Not working? You might want to install the dependency [vc_redist](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)

## Windows Installation Epic
1. Download the newest [release](https://github.com/Eisbison/TheOtherRoles/releases/latest)
2. Find the folder of your game. Should be stored in "Epic/AmongUs" (wherever you installed Epic on your PC)
3. Now unzip and drag or extract the files from the .zip into the original Epic Among Us game folder.
4. Run the game by starting the game in your Epic Games launcher (the first launch might take a while).

Not working? You might want to install the dependency [vc_redist](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)

![Install](https://i.imgur.com/pvBAyZN.png)

## Linux Installation
1. Install Among Us via Steam
2. Download newest [release](https://github.com/Eisbison/TheOtherRoles/releases/latest) and extract it to ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Among Us
3. Enable winhttp.dll via the proton winecfg (https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/advanced/proton_wine.html)
4. Launch the game via Steam

## The Other Roles Custom Servers
**A custom server is not necessary and official servers are working just fine with the mod, but in case you want to set up and host your own server, here's a guide for you to follow.**

**Setup the Server:**
1. Get the Impostor release (https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor)
2. Follow the steps (using the server release you just downloaded) on the official Impostor-Documentation (https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor/wiki/Running-the-server)
3. Make sure to set the following values to false in the config.json file:
```    ...
     'AntiCheat': {
       'Enabled': false,
      'BanIpFromGame': false
    }
```
4. Make sure to forward the right ports on the hosting machine.
5. Run the server and setup the client.
Setting up Server as Docker Container:
If you want to run the server as a docker container you'll need to use the image
aeonlucid/impostor:nightly

(Currently only the 'nightly' tag is starting a server supporting 2021.3.31 or later)
In addition to running it we need to set the environment variables to disable the AntiCheat feature.
IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatEnabled=false
IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatBanIpFromGame=false

Example to docker run command:
docker run -p 22023:22023/udp --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatEnabled=false --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatBanIpFromGame=false aeonlucid/impostor:nightly

Or use to run it in the background
docker run -d -p 22023:22023/udp --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatEnabled=false --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheatBanIpFromGame=false aeonlucid/impostor:nightly

**If you have any problems regarding custom servers, please contact https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor or https://discord.gg/ThJUGAsz**

### 地圖任務數上限
你可以設定:
- 最多 4 個普通任務
- 最多 23 個短任務
- 最多 15 個長任務

Please note, that if the configured option exceeds the available number of tasks of a map, the tasks will be limited to that number of tasks. \
Example: If you configure 4 common tasks on Airship crewmates will only receive 2 common tasks, as airship doesn't offer more than 2 common tasks.

| 地圖 | 普通任務 | 短任務 | 長任務 |
|----------|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Skeld / Dleks | 2 | 19 | 8
| Mira HQ | 2 | 13 | 11
| Polus | 4 | 14 | 15

-----------------------

### 隨機地圖
**隨機地圖** 如果啟用，它允許您為每個當前地圖設置百分比。

**完成任務前作祟或縮放** 您必須先完成任務，然後才能縮放。

**使用隨機地圖設定組:** When this option is turned on, the game will switch to the `隨機地圖設定組 <MapName>` when a game is started on a random map. **This includes vanilla options!**. This makes it possible to e.g. play with less tasks on large maps like Airship.
The game will **保持** in the preset for that random map after the match.

The random map presets can still be used like normal presets, if you **關閉** `隨機地圖` (make sure you do this in all presets you are using).



# 自定義帽子
## Create and submit new hat designs
We're awaiting your creative hat designs and we'll integrate all the good ones in our mod.
Here are a few instructions, on how to create a custom hat:

- **Creation:** A hat consists of up to three textures. The aspect ratio of the textures has to be `4:5`, we recommend `300px:375px`:
  - `Main texture (required)`:
    - This is the main texture of your hat. It will usually be rendered in front of the player, if you set the `behind` parameter it will be rendered behind the player.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern *hatname.png*, but you can also set some additional parameters in the file name by adding `_parametername` to the file name (before the *.png*).
    - Parameter `bounce`: This parameter determines whether the hat will bounce while you're walking or not.
    - Parameter `adaptive`: If this parameter is set, the Among Us coloring shader will be applied (the shader that replaces some colors with the colors that your character is wearing in the game). The color red (#ff0000) will be replaced with the primary color of your player and the color blue (#0000ff) with the secondary color. Also other colors will be affected and changed, you can have a look at the texture of the [Crewmate Hat](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/among-us-wiki/images/e/e0/Crewmate_hat.png) to see how this feature should be used.
    - Parameter `behind`: If this parameter is set, the main texture will be rendered behind the player.
  - `Flipped texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered instead of the Main texture, when facing the left.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_flip.png`.
  - `Back texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered behind the player.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_back.png`.
  - `Flipped Back texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered instead of the Back texture, when facing the left.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_back_flip.png`.
  - `Climb texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered in front of the player, when they're climbing.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_climb.png`.
- **Testing:** You can test your hat design by putting all the files in the `\TheOtherHats\Test` subfolder of your mod folder. Then whenever you start a Freeplay game, you and all the dummies will be wearing the new hat. You don't need to restart Among Us if you change the hat files, just exit and reenter the Freeplay mode.

- **Submission:** If you got a hat design, you can submit it on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/77RkMJHWsM). We'll look at all the hats and add all the good ones to the game.

# 顏色
Note: Lighter and Darker colors are no longer based on the players color. Instead they are assigned alternatingly, s.t. they are always balanced in a lobby.

A big thank you goes to Avlona & Listoric for sorting the colors in the best possible order (which is surprisingly hard to do)!

# 職業

## 職業分配

First you need to choose how many special roles of each kind (偽裝者/獨立/船員) you want in the game.
The count you set will only be reached, if there are enough 船員/偽裝者 in the game and if enough roles are set to be in the game (i.e. they are set to > 0%). The roles are then being distributed as follows:
- First all roles that are set to 100% are being assigned to arbitrary players.
- After that each role that has 10%-90% selected adds 1-9 tickets to a ticket pool (there exists a ticket pool for 船員, Neutrals and 偽裝者). Then the roles will be selected randomly from the pools as long it's possible (until the selected number is reached, until there are no more Crewmates/偽裝者s or until there are no more tickets). If a role is selected from the pool, obviously all the tickets of that role are being removed.
- The 黑手黨, 戀人 and 迷你 are being selected independently (without using the ticket system) according to the spawn chance you selected. After that the 船員, 獨立 and 偽裝者 roles are selected and assigned in a random order.

**範例:**\
Settings: 2 special Crewmate roles, Snitch: 100%, Hacker: 10%, Tracker: 30%\
Result: Snitch is assigned, then one role out of the pool [Hacker, Tracker, Tracker, Tracker] is being selected\
Note: Changing the settings to Hacker: 20%, Tracker: 60% would statistically result in the same outcome .

下面列出了多個選項，您可以根據自己的喜好進行配置。\
與吸血鬼類似，盾牌和填空將被檢查兩次(在對玩家施放法術結束時和會議結束巫術發動時)。\
這可能導致玩家在會議期間被標記為被下蠱，但最後不會死亡(當他們獲得盾牌或巫師在施放巫術後被填空)。\
如果巫師在會議開始前死亡，或者在會議期間被賭徒猜出巫師，那麼被下蠱的玩家將被突顯，但他們會活下來。\
根據選項設定，您可以選擇將巫師票出是否會拯救所有被下蠱的玩家。\

## 豺狼
### **隊伍:豺狼**
豺狼是一個額外隊伍的一部分，需要消滅所有其他玩家。\
豺狼沒有任務，可以殺死偽裝者，船員和獨立玩家。\
豺狼(如果設定開啟)可以選擇另一個玩家作為他們的同伴。
招募跟班會移除跟班的所有任務，並讓它們加入到豺狼隊伍中。跟班將會失去他們目前的職業(除非他們是戀人，這樣他們會被分成兩隊)。
"招募跟班"每個豺狼只能使用一次，或者每個遊戲使用一次(取決於設定)。
豺狼也可以讓偽裝者成為他們的同伴，但是根據設定的不同，偽裝者要麼真的變成同伴並離開偽裝者，要麼他只會看起來像豺狼的同伴並保持原來不變。\
此外，如果間諜或偽裝者被招募，他們在偽裝者眼裡仍然還會是紅色的。

豺狼隊伍讓遊戲的多個新結果，此處列出了一些範例：
- 偽裝者被淘汰，然後船員與豺狼對抗。
- 船員被淘汰，然後豺狼隊與偽裝者對抗(這種情況下，船員仍然可以解完任務獲勝)

獲勝條件的優先順序如下：
1. 迷你船員被投出輸掉
2. 小丑被投出獲勝
3. 縱火犯獲勝
4. 偽裝者以破壞勝利
5. 船員解完任務獲勝(就算都死了還是能)
6. 戀人在最後三名玩家中獲勝
7. 豺狼隊伍以多數獲勝(當豺狼包含的玩家數量等於或多於船員，並剩下0個偽裝者與豺狼隊伍不包含戀人時)
8. 偽裝者隊伍以多數獲勝(當偽裝者包含的玩家數量等於或多於豺狼，並剩下0個豺狼與偽裝者隊伍不包含戀人時)
9. 船員隊伍以多數獲勝(當沒有豺狼並且偽裝者離開時)

**NOTE:**
- 豺狼(和跟班)可能會被警長殺死。
- 當迷你還在成長，豺狼不能瞄準他。成年之後，他們可以殺死他或選擇他作為跟班。
- 即使所有船員都死了，他們夠快地完成任務，船員仍然可以獲勝(這就是為什麼將剩下最後一個未解完任務的船員轉換為跟班將導致船員獲勝。)

如果偽裝者和豺狼都在遊戲中，就算所有船員都死了，遊戲也還是會繼續。在這種情況下，船員仍然可以通過完成他們的任務來獲勝。豺狼和偽裝者必須互相殘殺。

原告也是個獨立職業，但有個不同的目標來獲勝: 他們必須活到遊戲結束時(不管是誰獲勝)。
為了實現這個目標，原告擁有"填空"能力: 他們可以用空包彈填充殺手(包括警長)的武器，所以如果殺手試圖殺死某人將錯過目標並照常觸發所有冷卻時間。
如果殺手發射空包彈不會觸發任何盾(例如醫生盾或時間管理大師盾)。
